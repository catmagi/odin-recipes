    <h2>the <em>most amazing</em> lesbieon Falafel!</h2>
    <p>Falafel is a Middle Eastern dish made from chickpeas and/or fava beans. Traditionally, it is deep fried to yield a crispy texture and often served in a pita.</p>
    <p2>On september 23, 1993 I hit a dog with my ford f150 while hammered and kept on driving. <strong>This recipe is vegan!!</strong></p2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <!-- it'd be cool if the stuff in () was lighter color then the regular ingredients-->
    <ul>
        <li>1 15-ounce can chickpeas (rinsed, drained and patted dry)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley (or sub cilantro)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 medium shallots (minced // 2 shallots yield ~ 3/4 cup or 65 g // or sub white onion)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp raw semame seeds (or sub finely chopped nuts, such as pecans)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp cumin (plus more to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp each sea salt and black pepper (plus more to taste)</li>
        <li>1 healthy pinch each cardamom and coriander <em>(optional)</em></li>
        <li>3-4 Tbsp all-purpose flour (or sub oat flour or gluten-free blend with varied results)</li>
        <li>3-4 Tbsp avocado oil for cooking (or sub any neutral oil with a high smoke point)</li>
        <li>Panko bread crumbs for coating <em>(optional // see instructions // gluten-free as needed)</em></li>       
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add chickpeas, parsley, shallot, garlic, sesame seeds, cumin, salt, pepper (and coriander and cardamom if using) to a food processor or blender and mix/pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed until thoroughly combined. You’re looking for a crumbly dough, not a paste.</li>
        <li>Add flour 1 Tbsp (~8 g) at a time and pulse/mix to combine until no longer wet and you can mold the dough into a ball without it sticking to your hands – I used 4 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more salt, pepper, and a dash of cardamom and coriander. You want the flavor to be pretty bold, so don’t be shy.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a mixing bowl, cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours to firm up. <strong>If you’re in a hurry you can chill in the freezer for 45 minutes</strong> or skip this step – but they will be a little more fragile when cooking.</li>
        <li>Once chilled, scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts (~30 g in weight // I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000CDVD2/?tag=minimalistbaker-20">this scoop</a>) and gently form into 11-12 small discs (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).</li>
        <li><strong><em>OPTIONAL:</em></strong>Sprinkle on panko bread crumbs and gently press to adhere – flip and repeat. This will produce a crispier falafel, but it’s optional.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough oil to generously coat the pan – about 2 Tbsp (30 ml). Swirl to coat.</li>
        <li><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> If not cooking all of the falafel right away, FREEZE uncooked falafel between layers of parchment paper and store in a container in the freezer up to 1 month. Then just thaw and cook as instructed!</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, add only as many falafel as will fit very comfortably in the pan at a time – about 5-7.</li>
        <li>Cook for a total of 4-5 minutes, flipping when the underside is deep golden brown. Repeat until all falafel are browned – the deeper golden brown they are, the crispier they’ll be. They will also firm up more once slightly cooled.</li>
        <li><strong><em>OPTIONAL:</em></strong>For even crispier falafel, bake in a 400 degree F (204 C) oven for 5-10 minutes after pan frying (either on a baking sheet or your skillet if it’s oven-safe)!</li>
        <li>Serve warm with garlic-dill sauce or hummus, inside a pita or naan, and with desired toppings or atop a bed of greens.</li>
        <li>Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep in the refrigerator covered for 4-5 days. Freeze after that to keep fresh for up to 1 month. From thawed, reheat in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven for 15 minutes or until hot.</li>
